# 100-DaysOfCode
Starting the challenge where I would be coding on foundational things which all would be helpful for me while I attend coding rounds or interviews!
<br>
Irrespective of progamming languages!
<br> I would be solving basic to advance level problems!
<br> Starting from basic number problems upto the complex DS & Algos!
<br><i> As a bonus, i would be strengthning my Java coding skills after <b>2 years!
### Cheers!
